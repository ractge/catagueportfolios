          <h2>What are Network Devices?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row content">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
              The devices which are used for communication between different hardware’s used in the computer network are known as network devices. These devices are also known as physical devices, networking hardware, and network equipment otherwise computer networking devices. In a computer network, each network device plays a key role based on their functionality, and also works for different purposes at different segments.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Types of network devices</h2>
        </div>

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Network Hub</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Network Switch</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Modem</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Network Router</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Bridge</li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Repeater</li>
          
           <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Network Hub</h2>
        </div>
              The network hub is one kind of networking device in a computer network, used to communicate with various network hosts and also for data transferring. The transferring of data in a computer network can be done in the form of packets. Whenever the data processing can be done from a host to a network hub, then the data can transmit to all the connected ports. Similarly, all the ports identify the data path which leads to inefficiencies & wastage. Because of this working, a network hub cannot be so safe and secure. In addition, copying the data packets on all the ports will make the hub slower which leads to the utilize of the network switch.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Active Hub</h2>
        </div>
              These hubs have their own power supply and these hubs are used to clean, increase & transmit the signal using the network. It works as a wiring center & repeater. Active hubs play a key role in extending the distance between nodes.

               <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Passive Hub</h2>
        </div>
              These hubs collect wiring from the power supply and different nodes of an active hub. These hubs transmit the signals over the network without improving & cleaning them. These hubs are not suitable for extending the distance between nodes like an active hub.

               <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Network Switch</h2>
        </div>
              Similar to a hub, this is also working at the layer in the LAN and a switch is more clever compare with a hub. As the hub is used for data transferring, whereas a switch is used for filtering & forwarding the data. So this is the more clever technique to deal with the data packets.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Modem</h2>
        </div>
              A modem is the most important network device and it is used daily in our life. If we notice the internet connection to homes was given with the help of a wire. then wire carries internet data from one place to another. But, every computer gives digital or binary data in the form of zeros & ones.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Network Router</h2>
        </div>
              A network router is one kind of network device in a computer network and it is used for routing traffic from one network to another. These two networks could be private to a public company network. For example, here a router is considered as traffic police at the junction, he directs dissimilar traffic networks to dissimilar directions.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Bridge</h2>
        </div>
              A Bridge in the computer network is used to unite two or more network segments. The main function of a bridge in network architecture is to store as well as transmit frames among the various segments. Bridges use MAC (Media Access Control) hardware for transferring frames.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Repeater</h2>
        </div>
              The operating of a repeater can be done at the physical layer. The main function of this device is to reproduce the signal on a similar network before the signal gets weak otherwise damaged. The significant point to be noted regarding these devices is that they do not strengthen the signal. Whenever the signal gets weak, then they reproduce it at the actual strength. A repeater is a two-port device.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Gateway</h2>
        </div>
              Generally, a gateway performs at the session & transport layers in the OSI model. Gateways offer conversion between networking technologies like OSI (Open System Interconnection) & TCP/IP. Because of this, these are connected to two or many autonomous networks, where each network has its own domain name service, routing algorithm, topology, protocols, and procedures of network administration & policies.

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Brouter</h2>
        </div>
              The Brouter is also called a bridging router and the main function of this is to combine the features of both router & bridge and router. It performs either at the network layer or the data link layer. When it works as a router, it is used for routing packets across networks whereas it works as a bridge; it is used for filtering LANs traffic.

          <h2>How to Troubleshoot Common PC Hardware Problems</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2></h2>
        </div>
            Some of the most common PC hardware problems that need troubleshooting are:

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Your computer won’t turn on. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Your computer turns on, but still doesn’t work. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Your computer screen freezes. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Your computer has insufficient memory. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>You get a CMOS error. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Your operating system is missing or your hard drive isn’t detected. </li>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>You get the blue screen of death. </li>


              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #1: Your Computer Won’t Turn On</h2>
        </div>
              This is a common problem that often offers a simple solution.

              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Is everything plugged in? I can’t tell you how many times I have come across a “broken” computer that simply had an unplugged component. </li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Try plugging into different power outlets. It isn’t uncommon to blow a fuse, especially with more power-hungry systems. </li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Is either the monitor, mouse, or keyboard the only thing not working? If so, try plugging in a different one to see if that does the job. Most of the time, replacing one of these is cheaper than attempting a repair. </li> 


              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #2: Your Computer Turns On, But Still Doesn’t Work</h2>
        </div>
              If power is obviously flowing to the computer system and its peripherals, there may be a component issue. When you first turn on the computer, do you hear or see anything out of the ordinary? Many times the computer’s Power-On Self-Test (POST) will let you know what’s going on with the machine.  


              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #3: Your Computer Screen Freezes</h2>
        </div>
              When your computer freezes and isn’t responsive to your mouse or keyboard, the first thing to do is just wait. Sometimes it will just take a few minutes for your computer to process. Then, end-task the non-responding program. If that doesn’t work, turn off the computer by holding down the power button and then rebooting into Safe Mode (don’t forget about saving your work first, if you can). 

              If you’ve tried all of this and your computer still won’t unlock, you may be dealing with either defective hardware or a defective device driver. If this is your case, replace the defective piece immediately so it doesn’t cause further damage. 
              

              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #4: Your Computer Has Insufficient Memory</h2>
        </div>
              Receiving an “insufficient memory or disk space” error message can usually be solved (at least temporarily) by closing extra windows to free up some RAM. If you’ve done that and the error still comes up, you can try rebooting your computer and installing the latest operating system update. 


              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #5: You Get a CMOS Error</h2>
        </div>
            The CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) is an onboard chip that stores information ranging from the time and date to system hardware settings. If you get a CMOS alert message showing up on your screen, it’s likely you need to replace the CMOS battery located on the motherboard. Remove it carefully, insert a new battery that is exactly the same as the old one, and enter the CMOS values to the defaults.


              <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #6: Your Operating System Is Missing or Your Hard Drive Isn’t Detected</h2>
        </div>
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The basic input/output system (BIOS) doesn’t detect Windows’ hard disk, or the disk failed. If you know how, take out the hard drive and reconnect it. If that doesn’t work, the hard drive’s interface is forbidden or the hard drive is seriously damaged.  </li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The BIOS settings are incorrect. Set the BIOS back to Default State. </li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> The Master Boot Record (MBR) is damaged or corrupted. Rebuild the MBR using either the Windows installation disk, the Windows repair disk, or a bootable partitioning tool. </li> 
              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>The Windows boot file partition isn’t active. Start the computer using a bootable partitioning tool. If that doesn’t work, set the wrong partition to ‘inactive’ and activate the correct partition. </li> 


                <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Problem #7: The Blue Screen of Death</h2>
        </div>
              The blue screen of death (BSOD) appears when Microsoft Windows has an unrecoverable, critical error that causes a crash and subsequent data loss. This can be caused by the low-level software in Windows crashing. 

              When the BSOD occurs, the computer automatically creates a minidump file and restarts the computer. If the blue screen appears again, follow the prompts, identify and search for the error code online, and learn how to fix the problem.
